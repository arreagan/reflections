When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with other people or
when you want to be able to access your code from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to continue working on a project independendently without
being affected by what other users are doing on GitHub.
