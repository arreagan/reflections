When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with other people or
when you want to be able to access your code from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to continue working on a project independendently without
being affected by what other users are doing on GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow you to clone a repository on GitHub while linking to the original.
GitHub does this for you. Clones are copies of repositories that can be downloaded
from GitHub to your computer. You can also clone multiple versions of repositories
on your computer. Branches are different sets of commits that are used to separate
different sets of processes and let you have a more organized structure. When the
changes present in another branch are ready to be incorporated they can be merged into
the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see how the remote copy has diverged from the one on your computer.
You can see changes that other users may have made.
